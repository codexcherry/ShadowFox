## AI-Driven Natural Language Processing Project

### Language Model Selection
Our project begins with the careful selection of Google's FLAN-T5-Small model, chosen after evaluating multiple language models for agricultural applications. We selected this specialized instruction-tuned model for its exceptional ability to follow natural language instructions while maintaining efficient computational requirements. The model's architecture provides an optimal balance between performance and resource utilization, making it ideal for deployment in greenhouse management systems where real-time responses are critical.

### Implementation Workflow
The implementation process follows a systematic workflow in `utils/llm_assistant.py`:
1. First, we initialize the FLAN-T5-Small model with appropriate parameters for agricultural domain tasks
2. Next, we implement robust rule-based fallback mechanisms to ensure system reliability during API disruptions
3. Then, we integrate domain-specific knowledge about crops, growing conditions, and greenhouse management
4. Finally, we develop a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that enhances responses with contextual environmental data

### Exploration and Analysis Process
Our exploration process in `test_llm_assistant.py` follows a structured methodology:
1. We begin by testing basic question-answering capabilities with simple greenhouse management queries
2. Then we evaluate the model's context-awareness by implementing and testing the RAG system with environmental logs
3. Next, we assess the crop recommendation system using various temperature and moisture parameters
4. Finally, we analyze performance across different input scenarios to identify strengths and limitations

### Research Questions and Methodology
Our research methodology addresses five key questions through systematic experimentation:
1. We evaluate the model's agricultural domain expertise by comparing responses to expert knowledge
2. We measure improvements in contextual understanding by comparing standard responses to RAG-enhanced outputs
3. We analyze the trade-offs between rule-based fallbacks and full LLM implementation through reliability testing
4. We assess real-time performance by integrating environmental data streams and measuring response quality
5. We examine ethical considerations through a framework analyzing bias, transparency, and decision impact
